NAME
    Unicode::UTF8 - Encoding and decoding of UTF-8 encoding form.

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::UTF8 qw[decode_utf8 encode_utf8];
    
        $string = decode_utf8($octets);
        $octets = encode_utf8($string);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides functions to encode and decode UTF-8 encoding form
    as defined by Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646:2011.

FUNCTIONS
  decode_utf8($octets)
    Returns an decoded representation of $octets in UTF-8 encoding as a
    character string.

    Issues a warning if $octets contains an ill-formed UTF-8 sequence or an
    encoded code point which can't be interchanged.

  encode_utf8($string)
    Returns an encoded representation of $string in UTF-8 encoding as an
    octet string.

    Issues a warning if $string contains a code point which can't be
    interchanged or represented in UTF-8 encoding form.

EXPORTS
    None by default. All functions can be exported using the ":all" tag or
    individually.

DIAGNOSTICS
    Can't decode a wide character string
        (F) Wide character in octets.

    Can't decode ill-formed UTF-X octet sequence <%s> in position %u
        (F) Encountered an ill-formed octet sequence in Perl's internal
        representation of wide characters.

    Can't decode ill-formed UTF-8 octet sequence <%s> in position %u
        (W utf8) Encountered an ill-formed UTF-8 octet sequence. <%s>
        contains a hexadecimal representation of the maximal subpart of the
        ill-formed subsequence.

    Can't interchange noncharacter code point U+%.4X
        (W utf8) Noncharacters is permanently reserved for internal use and
        that should never be interchanged. Noncharacters consist of the
        values U+nFFFE and U+nFFFF (where n is from 0 to 10^16) and the
        values U+FDD0..U+FDEF.

    Can't represent surrogate code point U+%.4X in UTF-8 encoding form
        (W utf8) Surrogate code points are designated only for surrogate
        code units in the UTF-16 character encoding form. Surrogates consist
        of code points in the range U+D800 to U+DFFF.

    Can't represent super code point \x{%X} in UTF-8 encoding form
        (W utf8) Code points greater than U+10FFFF. Perl's extended
        codespace.
