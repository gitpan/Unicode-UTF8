=head1 NAME

Unicode::UTF8 - Encoding and decoding of UTF-8 encoding form.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Unicode::UTF8 qw[decode_utf8 encode_utf8];
    
    $string = decode_utf8($octets);
    $octets = encode_utf8($string);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions to encode and decode UTF-8 encoding form as 
defined by Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646:2011.

Here is a summary of features for comparison with L<Encode>:

=over 4

=item *

simple API which integrates with warnings category C<utf8>

=item *

recognizes all noncharacters regardless of perl version

=item *

implements Unicode's recommended practice for using U+FFFD

=item *

helpful diagnostics in warnings messages

=item *

detects and reports inconsistency in perl's internal encoding (UTF-X)

=item *

preserves taintedness of decoded C<$octets> or encoded C<$string>

=item *

increased performance ~ 500% to 2000% L<https://github.com/chansen/p5-unicode-utf8/blob/master/benchmarks/bench.pl>

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 decode_utf8($octets)

Returns an decoded representation of C<$octets> in UTF-8 encoding as a character
string.

Issues a warning if C<$octets> contains ill-formed UTF-8 sequences or encoded 
code points which can't be interchanged.

=head2 encode_utf8($string)

Returns an encoded representation of C<$string> in UTF-8 encoding as an octet
string.

Issues a warning if C<$string> contains code points which can't be interchanged
or represented in UTF-8 encoding form.

=head1 EXPORTS

None by default. All functions can be exported using the C<:all> tag or individually.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Can't decode a wide character string

(F) Wide character in octets.

=item Can't decode ill-formed UTF-8 octet sequence <%s> in position %u

(W utf8) Encountered an ill-formed UTF-8 octet sequence. <%s> contains a 
hexadecimal representation of the maximal subpart of the ill-formed subsequence.

=item Can't interchange noncharacter code point U+%.4X at position %u

(W utf8) Noncharacters is permanently reserved for internal use and that
should never be interchanged. Noncharacters consist of the values U+nFFFE and
U+nFFFF (where n is from 0 to 10^16) and the values U+FDD0..U+FDEF.

=item Can't represent surrogate code point U+%.4X at position %u in UTF-8 encoding form

(W utf8) Surrogate code points are designated only for surrogate code units in the 
UTF-16 character encoding form. Surrogates consist of code points in the range 
U+D800 to U+DFFF.

=item Can't represent super code point \x{%X} at position %u in UTF-8 encoding form

(W utf8) Code points greater than U+10FFFF. Perl's extended codespace.

=item Can't decode ill-formed UTF-X octet sequence <%s> in position %u

(F) Encountered an ill-formed octet sequence in Perl's internal representation 
of wide characters.
