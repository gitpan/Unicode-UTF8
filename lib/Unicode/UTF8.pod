=head1 NAME

Unicode::UTF8 - Encoding and decoding of UTF-8 encoding form.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Unicode::UTF8 qw[decode_utf8 encode_utf8];
    
    $string = decode_utf8($octets);
    $octets = encode_utf8($string);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions to encode and decode UTF-8 encoding form as 
defined by Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646:2011.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 decode_utf8($octets)

Returns an decoded representation of C<$octets> in UTF-8 encoding as a character
string.

Issues a warning if C<$octets> contains an ill-formed UTF-8 sequence or an
encoded code point which can't be interchanged.

=head2 encode_utf8($string)

Returns an encoded representation of C<$string> in UTF-8 encoding as an octet
string.

Issues a warning if C<$string> contains a code point which can't be interchanged
or represented in UTF-8 encoding form.

=head1 EXPORTS

None by default. All functions can be exported using the C<:all> tag or individually.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Can't decode a wide character string

(F) Wide character in octets.

=item Can't decode ill-formed %s octet sequence <%s> in position %u

(W utf8) Encountered an ill-formed octet sequence.

=item Can't interchange noncharacter code point U+%.4X

(W utf8) Noncharacters is permanently reserved for internal use and that
should never be interchanged. Noncharacters consist of the values U+nFFFE and
U+nFFFF (where n is from 0 to 10^16) and the values U+FDD0..U+FDEF.

=item Can't represent surrogate code point U+%.4X in UTF-8 encoding form

(W utf8) Surrogate code points are designated only for surrogate code units in the 
UTF-16 character encoding form. Surrogates consist of code points in the range 
U+D800 to U+DFFF.

=item Can't represent super code point \x{%X} in UTF-8 encoding form

(W utf8) Code points greater than U+10FFFF. Perl's extended codespace.
